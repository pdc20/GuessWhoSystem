# GuessWhoSystem
A GUI system to help with *Guess Who?* tournaments.

The system takes data from a Google spreadsheet which records registrations from players wanting to join the tournament.
The data can then be manipulated and displayed in a readable manner as the tournament is running.

The system uses the PyQt5 GUI framework which means that the system is cross-platform. It also uses the Google Sheets 
API for Python.

It is currently WIP and we aim to finish this ASAP.
